## 💡 How It Works

The chatbot uses three main components:

1. **OpenAI Integration**: Connects to GPT-3.5 for generating responses
```python
def ai_response(query):
    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[...]
    )
```

2. **Chat History**: Maintains conversation context
```python
def create_ui(query, past):
    output = ai_response(query)
    past.append((query, output))
    return None, past
```

3. **Gradio UI**: Provides the user interface
```python
with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Glass()) as demo:
    gr.Markdown("<h1><center>Your AI Therapist</center></h1>")
    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()
    msg = gr.Textbox(placeholder="Write your message here")
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This is a prototype and should not replace professional medical advice or therapy
- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
- The chatbot's responses are generated by AI and should be treated as such
- Monitor your API usage to manage costs

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- No conversation data is stored permanently
- Chat history is maintained only during the active session
- API keys should be stored as environment variables
- Use HTTPS when deploying to production
